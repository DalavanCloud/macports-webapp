Hello All,


Welcome to Macports webapp.

The Idea is to create a final web app displaying these things about a particular port (eg: example.com/port/python27) :

1. Port Information
	
	All the port information will stored in port table .

2. Build History/Summary

	All the history as far as available will be stored.

3. Installation Statistics
	
	If a user volunteers for Statistics.
	Updated Statistics version will give a lot

4. Results of Livecheck

5. Git Log / Commit History

6. Links to track tickets for that port 

7. Binary Package status

8. Links for Pull Request(Optional)
